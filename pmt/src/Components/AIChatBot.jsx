            <p>AI chatbots are computer programs that use artificial intelligence (AI) to simulate human
                conversation, either written or spoken, to answer questions on a particular topic. They are
                often used in customer service, technical support, and other applications where a human
                customer support agent is not available or is not desired.</p>
